            <h2>Mission Stories</h2>
            <p>Every mission project has a story. From the child who received an education to the family who got clean water, from the community that heard the gospel for the first time to the church that was planted—each story represents a life changed and a community transformed.</p>
            <p>We regularly share mission stories through our services, newsletter, and social media. These stories remind us of why we do what we do and inspire us to continue making a difference.</p>
