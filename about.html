            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Harmony Church was founded with a simple yet profound vision: to create a place where everyone can belong, believe, and become who God created them to be. Since our beginning, we have been committed to building a community that reflects the love and grace of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>What started as a small gathering of faithful believers has grown into a vibrant community that welcomes people from all walks of life. Our journey has been marked by God's faithfulness, and we continue to see lives transformed through worship, fellowship, and service.</p>
